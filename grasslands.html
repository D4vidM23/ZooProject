<p> Grasslands, drier than forests, have diverse ecosystems (Natural Geographic Grassland, pp2). Here in the grasslands, you are surrounded by deserts or mountains, and there are little to no trees (Natural Geographic Grassland, pp3). Depending on which continent you live on, there are different species of animals. In the African Grasslands, the animals that are present are lions, wildabeest, zebras, elephants, etc... (Natural Geographic Grassland, pp7). </p>

<p> Elephants are currently the biggest land animal on the world standing around 3 meters and weighing around 4000kg to 7500kg (National Geographic Elephant Facts 2). To maintain this large frame, they spend 12 or more hours eating (National Geographic Elephant Facts 6).

<p> In the grasslands of North America, there lives another huge animal. Fully grown bison may grow up to 1.8 meters tall and weigh in at up to 2000 pounds or 907kg (Our National Mammal: Bison, Fact 1). Even though bison may be large, they're still able to run <q>up to 35 miles per hour</q> and are great swimmers (Our National Mammal: Bison, Fact 9).  </p>
